# This is the attempt at making a ASCII art drawing script

# Goal: Draw a 10 lines large triangle

# First idea: Make a loop that first adds "/""\" characters without a space between them and after the second line start adding spaces

# Maybe try a dictionary first?


# triangle_sides_dictionary = {"right": "\\", "left": "/"}

# print(triangle_sides_dictionary["left"],triangle_sides_dictionary["right"], sep= "")

# pyramid_right = {"right1": "\\", "right2": "  ""\\", "right3": "____""\\"}
# pyramid_left = {"left1": "  ""/", "left2": " ""/", "left3": "/"}


# print(pyramid_left["left1"]+pyramid_right["right1"],pyramid_left["left2"]+pyramid_right["right2"],pyramid_left["left3"]+pyramid_right["right3"], sep= "\n")
